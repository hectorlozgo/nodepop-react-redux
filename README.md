## ⚙️ Installation Backend **[Nodepop-api](https://github.com/davidjj76/nodepop-api.git)**
For the frontend to work you will need to clone **[Nodepop-api](https://github.com/davidjj76/nodepop-api.git)** beforehand.

Install the dependencies:

```
cd nodepop-api
npm install
```

Initialize it by doing `npm start`

The server will run by default at http://localhost:3001/swagger

Make sure the backend is running properly before using the frontend application.


## ⚙️ Installation Frontend Nodepop

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HLozano87/nodepop-react.git
cd nodepop-react
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure environment variables

### `.env.example` file

To simplify configuration, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` or create a new `.env` file and write the API URL you want to use:

```env
# Base URL of the Nodepop API
VITE_BASE_URL_API=http://localhost:3001
```

This way, other developers can copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the URL according to their local or production environment.



### 4️⃣ Run the app in development mode
